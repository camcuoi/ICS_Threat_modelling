This project is an initial version of a threat modelling template for ICS environments using the Microsoft Threat Modelling tool. The template is by no means perfect at this point, but it is usable.
This version is updated by adding some threats based on IEC 62443-3-3 and stencils network devices (router, switch, firewall) and Windows Platform
